# FoF Frontend Assessment
Hi developer. This is the frontend assessment for the front end job vacancy @ FoF (makes sense right).

## What does the repo contain
- The result of a hackathon to draw a timeline with D3js. It has been a collab between our devs, and has been hacked together
- A journey_generator.ex Elixir script to generate the SVG that in the index.html is generated by D3.

## What we expect
- A refactor on something you dislike
- A bit of a write down of how you've changed what you dislike
- Some details on how you've changed that
- A PR at the end of this :)

## Important to know
- You deliver a cloned repository, with your changes. Send us an email with the end result.
- No need to play around with the elixir file, but if you want to? Go ahead
- Try to stay within 2 hours, there is no need to go crazy with this. But you are free to spend whatever time you feel fit on your refactor
- If you don't think a refactor is the solution, show us what you think is the solution
- This assessment is just an extra tool to give us an inside in how you work and where your qualities lie. Don't sweat.
- You can ignore the Elixir file, but if you are interested, check it out :)
- Any questions? Email me at simon@fishonfire.com

Good luck!
